# image-sorting-face-recognition
This script detects faces in images and sorts them into folders based on recognized individuals using **Face Recognition**. Additionally, images without detected faces are classified based on their scene features (e.g., "beach", "city", etc.) using a **pre-trained InceptionV3 model**.
